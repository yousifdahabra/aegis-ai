###  AegisAI is built using the following technologies:

### Flutter
The app is built with the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/), enabling cross-platform development. This allows us to use a single codebase for mobile, desktop, and web applications.

### Laravel
The backend is powered by the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/), which provides a robust and secure API for handling user requests, managing authentication, and interacting with the database.

### Vue.js
For the web front-end, we use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), a progressive JavaScript framework that builds responsive and dynamic user interfaces, providing seamless interactions on the web.

### MySQL
The project uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as the relational database management system to store user data, quiz results, and security awareness progress securely.
