<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

###  AegisAI is built using the following technologies:

### Flutter
The app is built with the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/), enabling cross-platform development. This allows us to use a single codebase for mobile, desktop, and web applications.

### Laravel
The backend is powered by the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/), which provides a robust and secure API for handling user requests, managing authentication, and interacting with the database.

### Vue.js
For the web front-end, we use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), a progressive JavaScript framework that builds responsive and dynamic user interfaces, providing seamless interactions on the web.

### MySQL
The project uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as the relational database management system to store user data, quiz results, and security awareness progress securely.

> We began designing AegisAI by mapping the user flow, followed by creating wireframes and mockups. We iterated on the design until we achieved an ideal layout that ensures easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

<!-- Prompt Engineering -->
<img src="./readme/title7.svg"/>

###  AI-Driven Prompt Engineering for Dynamic Cybersecurity Assessments:

- This project uses AI-based prompt engineering to create dynamic and adaptive cybersecurity assessments. By designing questions based on user responses, it provides interactive and personalized feedback to help users improve their online safety and adopt better security practices.

#### 1. Role Definition
- AI acts as a **cybersecurity expert and educator** to assess user habits.

#### 2. Question Generation
- Dynamically generated questions based on **user responses**.
- Question types include:
  - **Input (open-ended)**.
  - **Multiple choice**.
  - **Checkbox**.
  - **Voice interaction** using **Speech-to-Text (STT)**.

#### 3. Target Audience and Goal
- Designed for **everyday users** with minimal technical knowledge.
- Goal: Improve **online safety practices** and mitigate risks.

#### 4. Question Sequencing
- Engages users by varying question types.
- Avoids repetition for a smoother experience.

#### 5. JSON Response Format
- Standardized responses for questions and feedback.
- Example question JSON:
  ```json
  {
      "type_question": "<question_type_id>",
      "gpt_question_id": "<question_id>",
      "question": "<question_title>",
      "options": ["<option_1>", "<option_2>", "..."] "(if applicable)",
      "user_answer": ["<selected_option_1>", "<selected_option_2>", "..."] "(if applicable)"
   }
#### 6. Feedback and Analysis
- Provides actionable insights and a score summary in JSON.
- Example question JSON:
  ```json
   {
      "result": {
      "analysis": "<feedback_summary>",
      "score": "<user_score>%"
      }
   }
#### 7. Previous Questions
- Provides actionable insights and a score summary in JSON.
- Example input for previous questions JSON:
  ```json
   {
      {"id": "<question_id>", "type_question": "<question_type_id>", "user_answer": ["<option_1>, <option_2>"]}
   }
